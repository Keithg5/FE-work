# Saltiest Hacker News Trolls

## PITCH
Build an app that uses Hacker News comment data to rank commenters based on comment sentiment (saltiness/negativity).

## MVP
App rates and ranks hacker news commenters by negativity of comment sentiment (limited to commenters who have made x number of posts). Allows users to search by username to view comments and sentiment levels of specific users.

- User creation/login flow
- User can view a feed of negative comments from DS API
- User can save their favorite salty comments to the backend
- User can delete saved comments

### STRETCH
App also displays the sentiment of individual comments by user allowing drilldown to a user view.

#### Web:
- Create a way to share the funniest/worst trolls on twitter.
- Use filter to display the cards in different ways depending on what the user wants to see and what is available in the DS API (ie funniest, most sarcastic, etc.)
- Create a way to visualize the trolls that show up most frequently in a given time period.
